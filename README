TransProCalc: README file
updated 03/04/08

TransProCalc requires ActiveTcl-8.5, which can be downloaded FREE
at http://www.activestate.com/store/productdetail.aspx?prdGuid=f0cd6399-fefb-466e-ba17-220dcd6f4078
If you are not running ActiveTcl-8.5, it won't work, because this latest Tcl, released in
December of 2007, includes new widgets and stuff that are not included in previous
Tcl releases, and TPC uses some of those features.

How to install TPC:

On Linux:
Copy tpcalc to /usr/local/bin/tpcalc
Copy tpcalendar to /usr/local/bin/tpcalendar

On Mac, I believe you should do as in Linux.
Essentially, all three scripts must be in your path.

Same for windows.  Just place all three scripts
in your path.  I'm not sure, but, I think that means
in your program files dir.

How to run TPC:

./tpcalc

On Linux, you can create a shortcut to wherever you've placed it
to make a desktop icon or menu item.
On Linguas Os the fluxbox menu item is
[exec] (TransProCalc) {/usr/local/bin/tpcalc} 

Or, to run it from a linux terminal do
$ cd /path/to/whereyouputit
$ ./tpcalc

I suppose a MacOS terminal should be able to do the same.
I'm not sure how that works from a DOS prompt, since I haven't
used Windows in about 8 years.
TransProCalc does work fine in Windows, though,
except that it doesn't print, unless you have lpr
with cygwyn, or something.
I know a few folks that are using it in Windows, and they tell me
it works great.  They just save reports and open with another editor
to print them, if they need them printed.

How to use TransProCalc:

Perhaps you can find other uses, but this is how I use TPC.
When a  project comes in, I use ProjectDocs to gather and organize information
on all documents, and ProjectAssign to organize information on assignments.
I generate and save these reports for future reference, so that I have this information
at my finger tips when it is time to organize and deliver the project to the client,
and create my invoice.
ProjectFin then generates an estimate of my charges and expenses,
and calculates an estimated gross revenue (not incl. deduction for taxes, etc.)
At the end of a project, when I invoice, ProjectFin gathers and organizes the
relevant financial information and generates a report which I give to my bookkeeper
with all invoices (mine to the client, any from providers), receipts and other relevant
documentation.  This gives her all the important information at a glance, which 
she can then enter into gnucash.

When working in TPC certain values will carry from one window to another, such
as Project No., Client ID, etc., for convenience.  Thus, you can generate all three
reports without re-entering information, as long as TPC remains open, and you
haven't pressed "Clear", which resets all variables.
TPC will save your reports, but it can not access that information once you have
closed the program, yet.  Thus, I end up re-entering data at the end of a project
when I create my ProjectFin report.
I'm working on the whole "save project / open project" bit.

I often paste all three reports to one file at the end of a project
and save as one project report.
You can copy any of the reports into another in TPC, in fact, and save all at once,
if you wish, as one report.  Do as you like.

If you ask for a calculation and you get "?" for an answer, it means TPC
is lacking information required to make the calculation, ie., you left a required
field blank.  Just put a zero in numerical fields for which you have no data.

You can use any of the TPCs three functions by itself, of course.
Say, a client wants an estimate on a project.
You can use tpcalc to crunch a few numbers.
You need not save or print reports, if you don't need/want them
Some folks may generate their info in TPC and enter into some
spreadsheet or database, for all I care.
Of course, a spreadsheet could be programmed to do nearly everything
TPC does, but, hey, isn't it nice to have a nice graphical application to
automagically do your math and hand you your data in a tidy report?

Okay, enough rambling.
If you like TransProCalc and want to drop me a line to say thanks,
go ahead and e-mail me at tonytraductor@linguasos.org
Likewise, do the same if you have any questions about using TPC,
and/or suggestions for new features.

If you have complaints about TPC, go waste some
money on some proprietary crap and leave us alone.
